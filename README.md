# SafeBank
This Project was built in Python to keep track of users' balances and login credentials for a Bank APP.
Using user-defined functions, reading a TXT document, and updating it if a user changes or adds newinformation to it.

This project is divided into 4 files.
SafeBank.py - Our main program that will then call all other files to work.
accounts.txt - This has our user's data, in this case (First name, Last name, Year of birth, and Money on the account)
functions.py - This file has all our functions to read user info and update it if requested by the user.
menus.py - This file has our main menu.
